# Solidity-101
## Introduction
Welcome! This is an automated workshop that will on using Solidity Smart contracts. It is aimed at developers who are not familiar with Solidity, or smart contracts.


## How to work on this TD
### Introduction
The workshop has two components:
- An ERC20 token, ticker TD-SOL-101, that is used to keep track of points 
- A set of 12 exercises that are able to mint and distribute TD-SOL-101 points

Your objective is to gather as many TD-SOL-101 points as possible. Please note :
- You will need testnet Ether to do this workshop. Lookup "rinkeby testnet faucet" on google.
- The 'transfer' function of TD-SOL-101 has been disabled to encourage you to finish the TD with only one address


### Getting to work
- The instructions for each exercice are included in the contracts of each exercice, in [contracts/exercices](contracts/exercices). 
- Each exercice contract inherits from the [exerciceTemplate](contracts/exerciceTemplate.sol), which holds common functions to validate students and credit points
- Each exercice is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet. You can interact with them through [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/contracts/interact), using the contract ABIs in [this folder](build/contracts), or through etherscan.
- In order to receive points, you will have to call function that execute code in each smart contract,  such that the function `creditStudent(n, msg.sender);` is triggered, and distributes n points.
- A low level description of what is expected can be inferred by reading the code in each exercice.
